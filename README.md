# Eye Controlled Mouse
A mouse system controlled by the eyes implemented using Python. This system employs computer vision techniques to track facial landmarks, particularly the eyes, and translate their movements into cursor actions on the screen. The main libraries used in this project are OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI.

## Prerequisites and Setup Environment
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3 installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with the OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI libraries.
- Webcam connected to your computer.

### Setup Environment:
1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Install OpenCV using pip:
     ```
     pip install opencv-python
     ```
   - Install Mediapipe using pip:
     ```
     pip install mediapipe
     ```
   - Install PyAutoGUI using pip:
     ```
     pip install pyautogui
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/fiaiaia/eye_controlled_mouse.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to Repository Directory:**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Run the `main.py` file using Python:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

5. **Interact with the Eye-Controlled Mouse:**
   - Once the script is running, position your face in front of the webcam.
   - Move your eyes to control the cursor on the screen.
   - Blink to simulate a mouse click.

6. **Exit the Application:**
   - To exit the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal/command prompt where the script is running.

Following these steps will help you set up the environment and run the eye-controlled mouse system successfully. Enjoy experimenting with eye-tracking technology!
